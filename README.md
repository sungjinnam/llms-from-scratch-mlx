This repo is to follow [LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/) using MLX, instead of PyTorch.
Although both packages share highly similar syntax, this is a learning process and (hopefully) preventing simple copy-and-paste from the original repo while following. 
LLM usage is limited for the learning purpose.
